""" QUESTION
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

SOLUTION
"""

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        size=len(nums)
        b=0
        for i in range(0,size):
            b=b^nums[i]
        return b
