""" QUESTION
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

Constraints: 1 <= n <= 45

SOLUTION
"""
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        a=1
        b=1
        for i in range(0,n):
            a=a+b
            b=a-b
        return b


// In C Language:
int climbStairs(int n){
    long long int a=1;
    long long int b=1;
    int i;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++){
        a=a+b;
        b=a-b;
    }
    return b;
